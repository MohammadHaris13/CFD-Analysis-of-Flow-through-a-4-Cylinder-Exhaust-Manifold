# CFD-Analysis-of-Flow-through-a-4-Cylinder-Exhaust-Manifold
Performed CFD simulation of a 4-cylinder exhaust manifold using Autodesk Inventor and ANSYS Fluent to analyze flow and heat transfer with Nitrogen Oxide Plus (NO⁺) as the working fluid. Studied velocity, pressure, and temperature distribution to ensure realistic exhaust performance and thermal behavior.
